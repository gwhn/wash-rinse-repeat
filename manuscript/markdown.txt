# Markdown

## Introduction

Markdown is a format designed for the web to be easy to read and write. You can
use HTML for any markup not covered by Markdown's syntax; block-level HTML
elements such as <div> or <table> just need to be separated with blank lines;
span-level HTML elements such as <span> or <cite> can be used anywhere in
Markdown.

## Block Elements

### Paragraph

A paragraph is one or more consecutive lines of text separated by one or more
blank lines.

### Headers

There are two styles of headers, underlined and hashed.

Underlined has two levels, one using equal signs, the other using dashes.
