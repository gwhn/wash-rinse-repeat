# Markdown

## Introduction

Markdown is a format designed for the web to be easy to read and write. You can
use HTML for any markup not covered by Markdown's syntax; block-level HTML
elements such as <div> or <table> just need to be separated with blank lines;
span-level HTML elements such as <span> or <cite> can be used anywhere in
Markdown.

## Block Elements

### Paragraph

A paragraph is one or more consecutive lines of text separated by one or more
blank lines.

### Headers

There are two styles of headers, underlined and hashed.

Underlined has two levels, one using equal signs, the other using dashes.

{linenos=off}
    First-level header
    ==================
    Second-level header
    -------------------

Any number of = or - symbols will work.

Hashed header use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line.

{linenos=off}
    # H1
    ## H2
    ### H3
    #### H4
    ##### H5
    ###### H6

### Blockquotes

Use > character either at the start of the first line of a paragraph or before
every line.

{linenos=off}
    > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. 
    > Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, 
    > viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
    
    > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. 
    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, 
    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

Blockquotes can be nested by adding another level of >
