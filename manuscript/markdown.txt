# Markdown

## Introduction

Markdown is a format designed for the web to be easy to read and write. You can
use HTML for any markup not covered by Markdown's syntax; block-level HTML
elements such as <div> or <table> just need to be separated with blank lines;
span-level HTML elements such as <span> or <cite> can be used anywhere in
Markdown.

## Block Elements

### Paragraph

A paragraph is one or more consecutive lines of text separated by one or more
blank lines.

### Headers

There are two styles of headers, underlined and hashed.

Underlined has two levels, one using equal signs, the other using dashes.

{linenos=off}
    First-level header
    ==================
    Second-level header
    -------------------

Any number of = or - symbols will work.

Hashed header use 1-6 hash characters at the start of the line.

{linenos=off}
    # H1
    ## H2
    ### H3
    #### H4
    ##### H5
    ###### H6

### Blockquotes

Use `>` character either at the start of the first line of a paragraph or before
every line.

{linenos=off}
    > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. 
    > Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, 
    > viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.
    
    > Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit. 
    Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi, 
    viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

Blockquotes can be nested by adding another level of `>`.

Blockquotes can contain other Markdown elements.

### Lists

Unordered lists use either `*`, `+` or `-`.

{linenos=off}
    * Red
    * Green
    * Blue
    
    + Red
    + Green
    + Blue
    
    - Red
    - Green
    - Blue

Ordered lists use numbers followed by a period (`.`).

{linenos=off}
    1. Red
    2. Green
    3. Blue

The numbering is not important, so the list could be written as:

{linenos=off}
    1. Red
    1. Green
    1. Blue

or:

{linenos=off}
    9. Red
    3. Green
    8. Blue

List markers must be followed by one or more space or a tab.

Hanging indents make a list look nice for wrapped lines.

{linenos=off}
    * Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, consectetuer adipiscing elit.
      Aliquam hendrerit mi posuere lectus. Vestibulum enim wisi,
      viverra nec, fringilla in, laoreet vitae, risus.

List items may have multiple paragraphs but each subsequent paragraph must be
indented by either 4 spaces or a tab.

To put a code block within a list item, indent the code block *twice*.

### Code Blocks

The lines of a code block are interpreted literally. Indent every line of the
block by at least 4 spaces or 1 tab.

This is a normal paragraph.

    This is a code block.

One level of indentation is removed from each line of the code block. It
continues until it reaches a line that is not indented.

### Horizontal Rules

Place three or more hyphens, asterisks or underscores on a line by themselves.
They may have spaces between them.

{linenos=off}
    * * *
    ***
    ****
    - - -
    ---
    ----
    _ _ _
    ___
    ____

## Span Elements

### Links

There are two types of link: *inline* and *reference*. Both types are delimited
by `[square brackets]`. To create an inline link, use `(regular parentheses)`
immediately after the link's closing `[square bracket]`. Inside the
parentheses, put the URL along with an *optional* title surrounded in quotes.

{linenos=off}
    This is [an example](http://example.com/ "Title") inline link.
    [This link](http://example.com/) has not title attribute.

If you're referring to a local resource on the same server, you can use
relative paths.

Reference links use a second set of `[square brackets]` with a label to
identify the link.

{linenos=off}
    This is an [example][id] reference link.

Then you define your link label anywhere in the document on a line by itself.

{linenos=off}
    [id]: http://example.com/ "Optional title"

The optional title attribute can be enclosed in double or single quotes or in
parentheses.

The link URL may, optionally, be surrounded by `<angle brackets>`.

You can put the title attribute on the next line and use extra spaces or tabs
for padding.

Link definition names may consist of letters, numbers, spaces and punctuation,
but are *not* case sensitive.

Implicit link name shortcut allows you to omit the name of the link.

{linenos=off}
    [Google][]
    [Google]: http://google.com/

Reference links are more readable than inline links.

### Emphasis

Asterisks and underscores indicate emphasis. 

Text wrapped with one will be wrapped in an `<em>` tag. 

Text wrapped with two will wrapped in a `<strong>` tag.

{linenos=off}
    *single emphasis*
    _single emphasis_
    **double emphasis**
    __double emphasis__

The same character must be used to open and close an emphasis.

You can escape an emphasis delimiter with a backslash.

### Code

Wrap a span of code with ```backtick quotes```.
