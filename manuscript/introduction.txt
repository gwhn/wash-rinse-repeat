I have just finished reading Practical Vim by Drew Neil. It's dense with
information and he points out in the Now What? chapter, that you've got to keep
practicing. I thought that composing this book would be a practical way of
doing that. 

As a software developer, I have to constantly keep my skills up to date.
Technology keeps moving forward and the techniques used to solve problems
evolve over time. I decided to make this book about that, hence the title.

I hope that a by-product of this process will be to instill a discipline in me to
not just read, but to ensure I have absorbed the knowledge and understand it.
I intend it to be more of a reference to trigger my memory rather than
a tutorial for others. Maybe others will get some value from it, but that's
just gravy.
